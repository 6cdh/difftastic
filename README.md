# Tree-Sitter Kotlin Grammar
[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org) language grammar for [Tree-Sitter](http://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/).

![Icon](Icon128.png)

The grammar is based on the [official language grammar](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/grammar.html).

_Note that the grammar is highly experimental and not suited for production usage yet!_

## Project Structure

| File | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| grammar.js | The Tree-Sitter grammar |
| grammar-reference.js | A direct translation of the Kotlin language grammar that is, however, ambiguous to Tree-Sitter |
| src | The generated parser |

## Setup

>`npm install`

## Compilation

To re-compile the grammar, run:

>`npm run generate`

Note that the grammar is written completely in JavaScript (`grammar.js`), the other source files are generated by `tree-sitter`.

## Testing

To run the unit tests, run:

>`npm run test`


## Documentation
