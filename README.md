# TreeSitterKotlin
[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org) language grammar for [Tree-Sitter](http://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/).

![Icon](Icon128.png)

The grammar is based on the [official language grammar](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/grammar.html).

_Note that the grammar is highly experimental and not suited for production usage yet!_

## Setup

First, make sure to have Node.js 8 installed. Then run

>`npm install -g tree-sitter-cli`

to install the parser generator.

## Compilation

To re-compile the grammar, navigate to the `tree-sitter` directory and run:

>`tree-sitter generate`

Note that the grammar is written completely in JavaScript (`grammar.js`), the other source files are generated by `tree-sitter`.

## Documentation

More documentation on how to create Tree-Sitter grammars [can be found here](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/creating-parsers).
