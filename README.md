# tree-sitter-commonlisp

WIP. Goal is to have a better syntax highlighting and some semantic refactoring https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter-refactor/.

All praise goes to https://github.com/sogaiu/tree-sitter-clojure which is extended by this grammar.

TODOs:

- support lisp packages: `foo.bar:symbol`
- support number literatls that are different from clojure (e.g. `.9`)
