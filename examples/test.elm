{-| An animation frame triggers about 60 times per second. Get the POSIX time
on each frame. (See [`elm/time`](/packages/elm/time/latest) for more info on
POSIX times.)

**Note:** Browsers have their own render loop, repainting things as fast as
possible. If you want smooth animations in your application, it is helpful to
sync up with the browsers natural refresh rate. This hooks into JavaScript's
`requestAnimationFrame` function.
